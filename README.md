Gamified Group Project

A Solidity-based smart contract that brings a gamified approach to managing group projects. The system allows for task creation, assignment, and rewarding participants upon task completion.

Vision

The Gamified Group Project aims to foster collaboration and engagement within group projects by introducing a rewarding system. It incentivizes task completion through decentralized and transparent reward distribution, making project management more interactive and motivating for all participants.
